# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project follows semver, so you can use every version from the changelog if you wish so, but usually you'd want to use the latest one, as that's the one that has the latest updates and goodies.

If there is a security version in the older version I can fix it, but usually it's always a better idea to use the latest version possible.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you've found a vulnerability in our library, please **don't open an issue**. Instead, responsibly disclose the vulnerability to me at denis.zoljom[at]gmail.com, so that I can investigate an issue and fix it as soon as possible.

Once the security issue has been disclosed I will respond in 1 - 3 days.

When reporting the vulnerability please provide as much detail as possible, so that it can be verified and reproduced.
